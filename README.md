6. Input field for correct user input  
7. Answer validation (correct/ incorrect)
8. Results

**Developer Goals** :

1. To help users enable their kids during
   early years of schooling

2. To encourage users to improve their
   knowledge  

3. To help parents engage their kids with something educative rather than computer games and watching cartoons on TV  

4. Quiz programmes like these can encourage users to read to gain more knowledge to enable them to be competitive

**User Goals:**

1.	As a first-time visitor, I want an interactive quiz site that is simple and easy to use

2.	As a first-time visitor, I want to easily navigate through the various questions involved in the quiz

3.	As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to test my knowledge and see how i have performed

4.	As a first-time visitor, i want the quiz to be self explanatory, rather than having to go through multiple paragraphs of instructions and options to select leading to various other pages and finding my way back

5.	As a first time, i want the quiz to prompt if i am correct or incorrect

6. As a first time visitor, i want to be able to play the game again

## **UX**

---

### **Strategy**

To be in line with UX principles, first i thought  of a strategy to identify who the target users would be and what features they are looking for

General knowledge quiz target users are:

* Aged 15 & over (Can be under 15's with parental permission to use electronics)
* quiz lovers
* People who are on the quest for knowledge

User requirements:

* Terminal program with no style and design
* Basic content for the understanding of kids under 15

### **Structure**

Quiz structure has various loops and functions in the backend and all that the user would see is a text input section to enter their name, once done a welcome message followed by questions, options and a text input for their guesses, which would then be validated with correct answers and result displayed as correct or incorrect. End of the quiz would be a scoreboard section to show the user of the guesses they made against the correct answers and their score in percentage

## **Features**

---

This program is designed with an intent to encourage users to test their knowledge, easy to use and meant for purpose with no overwhelming information.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  * Used to store code for the project after being pushed.
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
  * Used as the development environment.
* [codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/)
  * Used as the development environment.
* [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)
  * Used for deployment

### *User Stories*

1. **As a first-time visitor, I want an interactive quiz site that is simple and easy to use**

The quiz is terminal based so user have just 2 things to do enter their name and then their choices towards answers

3.	**As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to test my knowledge and see how i have performed**

The quiz has towards the end a screen that gives the correct answers against your guesses followed by score

4.	**As a first-time visitor, i want the quiz to be self explanatory, rather than having to go through multiple paragraphs of instructions and options to select leading to various other pages and finding my way back**

The quiz is simple and easy to use with just text input and not overwhelming information

5.	**As a first time, i want the quiz to prompt if i am correct or incorrect**

The quiz does prompt if the answer is correct or incorrect as you progress through the questions

6. **As a first time visitor, i want to be able to play the game again**

The progrm includes a function to play again, which prompts the user if they wish to play again or end the quiz

## Bugs

* The user name input was originally accepting letters, numbers and special characters. Have fixed that to ensure the user can only enter letters

* User guess input accepts other alphabets, including the allowed A, B, C & D. Working to fix this and will be sorted in next build

## Python code Validation

 I have validated my python code using CI python linter and found no errors but warnings, which i would be fixing. Please see below

Thanks to my mentor Harry Dhillon for all the inputs to fine tune the project
